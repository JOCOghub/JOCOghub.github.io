My application is a web application for a tattoo parlor called Anime Envy. I find it exhilirating for this project to be apart of my  portfolio. My web application can be slightly edited and used for any buisness that deal with scheduling appointments. I personly like how Rails prioratizes seperation of concerns even more that sinatra(in my opinion). Rails seperates the routes from the controller making it easier for the programmer to develop his or her application and it improves readability.  One thing that delayed my devbelopment was initially using the devise gem for omniAuth to give the user the ability to sign in with google. This took a lot of time and I ended up using the dotEnv gem instead. I often encounter this type of problem where I inittially use a gem that uses a lot more unnessecary files than another that does the same thing in a few lines of code. I always account for this when scheduling my time for development. In the future I would spend more time resaerching similliar gems and compare them before implementation. I look forward to using javascript with React in order to combine html with controller actions for I find that to be more optimal.
