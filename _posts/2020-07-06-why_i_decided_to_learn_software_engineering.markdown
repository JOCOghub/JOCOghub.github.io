Joseph Cohen

	 I decided to learn software engineering because I was fascinated with what code can create. Programs can increase efficiency in business, create worlds in the form of games and so much more. The ability to create programs is very exciting to me. Coding jobs are currently very high in demand on the job market and this is the other main reason I want to become a software engineer. I may also want to explore cybersecurity analytics because that too fascinates me.  To be able to use my future knowledge for intelligence agencies is a possible goal I may work towards.
