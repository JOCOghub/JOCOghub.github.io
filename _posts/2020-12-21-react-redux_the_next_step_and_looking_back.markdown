My final project is called museum organizer and it is a has many relationship where museums have many paintings.  The Front end of this project is run on React and Redux. React is a javascript library that is incredibly fast because it uses a virtual DOM that updates the real DOM with as little manipulation as apossible making the application very fast. Redux makes it easier to seperate handling information and logic by being able to import actions and set the state to what we need it to be. My rails application took a  lot of time to load new views but this application is lightning fast. Now I see how the power of javascript and why it is so commonly used in applications. After I graduate (with G-ds help) I plan on doing another bootcamp in cybersecurity. I found this course to be very well delivered and it gave me the tools I need to be a full stack developer. I've found that working in the backend and front end have different challenges. The backend focuses more on problem solving and the frontend focuses more on structuring and displaying information. The backend can be more complex to solve but also more straightforward unlike the frontend that mostly deals with sending and structuring the data that one has access too.

Advice that I would give myself on the first day would be as follows. A few hours spent well focused is better than an enire days work only half focused. Make sure you know the material before you start building. When you use code you find online make sure you first understand exacly what it is doing before you add it to your application. Finally, working in the morning is better than working late at night to make sure to get your sleep!
