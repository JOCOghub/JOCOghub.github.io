 I decided to have two seperate repositories for this project. The reason I did this was because I encountered an interesting problem when it came to havng to main folders for my project. Github kept giving me untracked files errors so I just made two seperate repositories for my fronend along with my backend. This solved the probelm and allowed me to actually continue building out my applicaiton.  This project uses AJAX and javascript to make fetch requests to this rails backend to access a database containing information about varried orchestras and the instruments that make them up. API's are a great way for developers to access information. For my first Flatiron project I sused a weather API to make a Command Line Application that would allow a user to enter a city and get the current weather for that city. For this application I created my own Rails API to give access to a database which contained varried orchestras and the instruments that belonged to each one. I used javascript to change the dom to allow the user to create and view orchestras with their instruments withiut having to reload the page. Javascript is powerful in this way by having this special capability that other languages don't have. However it is also very tedious, having to manually create the structure of the dom.
